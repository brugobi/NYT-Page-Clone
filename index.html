                                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, 
                                    an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                                    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
                                    stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond 
                                    the world of known physics.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of 
                                    some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. 
                                    Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused 
                                    space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the 
                                    universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens 
                                    look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
                                    ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not 
                                    missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double 
                                    box around it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                                    the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
                                    looked right.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
                                    for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="/">gravitational waves</a>gravitational waves — 
                                    the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
                                    trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, 
                                    proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
